# Programming-Portfolio
A small collection of my past work.

All work currently in this repository is work completed for University coursework at Abertay University Dundee.
All work has been completed and is owned by me unless otherwise stated. However, Abertay holds the rights to all coursework IPs.

All code is written in C++ with the exception of the Network Programming coursework which is written in GML and the Games Tool Programming which is written in C.
