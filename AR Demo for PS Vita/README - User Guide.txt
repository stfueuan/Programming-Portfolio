User Guide
		
On start-up of the application, the user will be greeted with a view from the rear-facing camera. 
On-screen, there are various UI elements to be aware of. Firstly, down the left-hand side of the 
screen is the scoreboard featuring the top 5 best times set by the player. Secondly, at the top 
of the screen sits the current lap timer. To start a race, the user has to simply accelerate the 
car (by pressing X) off of its starting position and the timer will start. The race will end by 
hitting the start position again or by resetting the car – the scoreboard will update automatically. 
Lastly, in the bottom right hand corner is the speedometer of the car and the frames per second counter. 

If, when the application loads, the screen is washed out or is too dark; simply press the triangle 
button to recalibrate the sensor. This is also useful if the Vita is finding it difficult to pick 
up the desired markers. 

To build a track to race upon, the user must place marker 1 in view of the camera. Then, by placing 
other markers near and around marker 1, more track pieces will appear on screen. When the other track 
pieces are close enough to marker 1, these will ‘snap’ to marker 1 and extend the track. Whilst 
constructing the track, each piece can be rotated (by rotating the marker) to fit the design the user 
is looking for. Once the user is happy with their creation, may the race begin! 

		Controls:
			X: Accelerate
			Square: Decelerate 
			Circle: Reset vehicle
			Triangle: Reset camera
			Left Analog Stick: Steer 

The car will rotate to a higher degree the more the analogue stick is rotated to the left or right. 
Thus, the analogue stick should be treated like a real steering wheel within a car.
